				capacity: max no. of resources your agent can carry. This can not be changed at run time.
				
				scan_range: max radius at which an agent can scan its grid. This can not be changed at run time.
				
				resource_type: resource an agent can collect. Can not be changed once set
				
				group: The group an agent belongs to. Can be set to any value from 0 to 6. 
				That is 0,1,2,3,4,5 and 6. This can be used to assign a different colour to agents to aid debugging 
				and also to differentiate them in advanced and/or competitive scenarios.
